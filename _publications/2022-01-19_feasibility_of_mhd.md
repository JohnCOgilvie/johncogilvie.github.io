Landing on Mars is one of the great challenges for the coming decades of spaceflight, specifically the ability to land heavier payloads at higher altitudes and from faster entry speeds. To accomplish this, new aerodeceleration technology will need to be validated and certified. One such technology may be magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) aerobraking. This paper investigates the feasibility of such a technology in the context of Martian entry.
