Understanding how the unpredictability of a missile may be optimised. As we travel toward the target, our range of viable impact sites diminishes. In an adversarial environment, this must be balanced with remaining unpredictable and thus harder to defend. We analyse how this optimisation may be done, examining different optimisation regimes and their impact on the flight path of the missile.
