Education
======
* Ph.D Candidate in Astrodynamics, UNSW Canberra, 2028 (currently enrolled)
* Bachelor of Engineering (Honours, first class) in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, University of Queensland, 2022
* Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, University of Queensland, 2022

Work experience
======
### Shoal Group
  * Modelling & Simulation Engineer: August 2024 - Present
    * Duties: After my graduate program, I have moved into the Decision Support Analytics team at Shoal. My work primarily consists of answering complex technical questions for defence and space clients. My role utilises my technical skills in software development, dynamics, and aerospace engineering as well as my strategic thinking and stakeholder management expertise daily as we help clients to make decisions, from question definition and scoping in the problem space all the way through to quantitative, evidence-based decision making.
  * Graduate Engineer: July 2022 - August 2024
    * Duties: In my first post-university role, I worked as a Graduate Engineer at Shoal in their Defence & Space department here in Canberra. This role enabled me to delve even further into aerospace and systems engineering, and contribute toward both small- and large-scale projects that will have meaningful impacts in the Australian space sector. In particular, I worked in a team simulating advanced aerodynamic systems, managed the entire R&D department of Shoal, and pushed my personal development further. I thrived in being able to learn as much as I can from, while getting experience with, one of the best space and M&S engineering organisations in the country, as well as being able to work on projects in a field I care deeply about and continue my space engineering story.

### Valiant Space
  * Work Experience Engineer: April 2021 - April 2022
    * Duties: Valiant Space are in the business of design and manufacture of non-toxic, in-space liquid propulsion systems. As a Work Experience Engineer, my tasks were investigation into design standards for space-qualified propulsion system components and general assistance with investigations and design work.

### Airbus, Australia Pacific
  * Work Experience Engineer: January 2020 - July 2020
    * Duties: Reporting to Team Lead Engineering Capability, my role was responsible for working within a structural engineering team to investigate, and assist with development and delivery of design solutions, using a systems engineering design philosophy, in accordance with the level and scope of Engineering Authority delegated to me.
