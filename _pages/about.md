Hi! Welcome to my academic and professional portfolio website (as distinct from my non-academic website, link coming soon). This is a Medina Station of sorts to redirect or point you towards any of my non-fiction writing, publications, talks, or projects, and to serve as an academic and professional overview of me and my interests. 

I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of New South Wales, based on their Canberra campus at the Australian Defence Force Academy (though I am not in the Defence Force), and I work part-time with Shoal Group as a Modelling & Simulation Engineer to support decision-making in Defence and Space. My research project revolves around spacecraft navigation, specifically in trajectory design, even more specifically in cislunar applications. How do we move in this region of space? How can we improve? What dynamics drive this motion? The Moon beckons, and we as a species have decided to return - I want to do my bit with the tools I have at my disposal to be a part of what will surely be the greatest undertaking of our generation. I hope. And if not, in the meantime, I get to learn about fascinating and beautiful maths and how the universe works. I mean, look at this: 
![Invariant Manifolds of the L1 libration point orbit [1]](../images/l1_libration_orbit_invariant_manifolds.png)
![3-body orbits around the Moon [2]](../images/3_body_orbits.jpg)
![Members of the L1 quasi-halo family of orbits [3]](../images/l1_quasi_halo_family.png)

Just try and tell me things like this don't just draw you in and make you want to understand, to hear what music moves them.
