Identifying novel strategies for optimal sampling for expensive simulation. CFD is a computationally expensive tool, especially when applied to the complex systems of the aerospace domain. We do however have a good understanding of the general physical model that these systems will follow, and so we can develop an error metric for each sample run. Utilising an adaptive sampling technique, we can thus focus on the areas of physical complexity, such as near aerodynamic stall, while sampling more sparingly in regions of linear behaviour.
